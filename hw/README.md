# OurBox product family

OurBox follows the product-family naming system defined by Model → Trim → SKU.

- **Model** = size/form-factor class (physical contract).
- **Trim** = intent label (not a spec sheet).
- **SKU** = exact BOM + software build, including incidental variants like color, capacity, or vendor.

Authoritative naming guidance lives in
[`hw/docs/decisions/ADR-0001-ourbox-model-trim-sku-part-numbers.md`](./docs/decisions/ADR-0001-ourbox-model-trim-sku-part-numbers.md).
