# Installer runtime fetch (Matchbox)

## Defaults
- Config shipped in image: `/opt/ourbox/installer/defaults.env`
- Optional override on boot media: `/boot/firmware/ourbox-installer.env`

`defaults.env` is rendered at installer image build time. It is not a static checked-in runtime file.

Key variables:
- `INSTALL_DEFAULTS_REF` (default `ghcr.io/techofourown/sw-ourbox-os/install-defaults:stable`)
- `INSTALLER_ID` (`matchbox`)
- `INSTALLER_VERSION` — installer artifact version baked at image build time
- `INSTALLER_GIT_HASH` — git SHA of this repo baked at image build time
- `OS_REPO` (default `ghcr.io/techofourown/ourbox-matchbox-os`)
- `OS_TARGET` (`rpi`)
- `OS_CHANNEL` (`stable`) – fallback channel if no explicit default ref is provided
- `OS_DEFAULT_REF` (optional digest/tag ref for "press ENTER" default)
- `CHANNEL_STABLE_TAG`, `CHANNEL_BETA_TAG`, `CHANNEL_NIGHTLY_TAG`, `CHANNEL_EXP_LABS_TAG`
- `OS_REF` (full ref, bypasses channel)
- `OS_CATALOG_ENABLED` (`1`) and `OS_CATALOG_TAG` (`${OS_TARGET}-catalog`)
- `OS_ORAS_VERSION` (`1.3.0`)
- `OS_REGISTRY_USERNAME` / `OS_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (optional for private repos)

## Artifact contract (oras pull)
- Type: `application/vnd.ourbox.matchbox.os-image.v1`
- Required files:
  - `os.img.xz`
  - `os.img.xz.sha256` (first field is the digest; required, install fails if missing/invalid)
  - `os.meta.env` (KEY=VALUE; include version/target/sku/k3s/git sha + platform contract digest)
- Optional: `os.info`, `build.log`

## Runtime UX
- Shared selection policy is sourced from `/opt/ourbox/tools/installer-selection-resolver.sh`, the
  upstream reference resolver defined in `sw-ourbox-os`.
- The vendored resolver copy is checked in CI against the upstream revision recorded in
  `tools/installer-selection-resolver.upstream.env`.
- Installer loads baked defaults, then attempts to pull `${INSTALL_DEFAULTS_REF}` and apply `defaults/${INSTALLER_ID}.env`.
- If remote defaults pull fails, installer falls back to baked defaults.
- Boot-media override (`/boot/firmware/ourbox-installer.env`) is applied last and wins.
- A non-empty baked `OS_DEFAULT_REF` remains in force unless remote install-defaults explicitly replaces it with another non-empty ref.
- Installer shows both NVMe disks and requires an explicit SYSTEM-disk choice; the other NVMe becomes DATA for that install.
- If the chosen SYSTEM disk currently carries `LABEL=OURBOX_DATA`, installer requires an explicit repurpose confirmation before clearing that label and continuing.
- If the chosen DATA disk already contains OurBox state, installer offers `RESET-BOOTSTRAP`, `ERASE-DATA`, or `KEEP-DATA`.
- `KEEP-DATA` preserves existing DATA contents; bootstrap re-runs automatically on next boot only when the shipped contract state changed.
- Default action order:
  1) `OS_REF` (if set)
  2) `OS_DEFAULT_REF` (if set)
  3) newest valid digest-pinned catalog row for `OS_CHANNEL`
  4) `${OS_REPO}:<tag for OS_CHANNEL>` fallback (stable/beta/nightly/exp-labs mapping)
- Catalog resolution is row-order independent: it filters by channel, requires a digest-pinned
  `pinned_ref`, and picks the newest row by `created`.
- Floating refs are resolved to digests with `oras resolve` and pulled immutably by digest; the
  installer fails closed unless `OURBOX_ALLOW_UNRESOLVED_PULL=1` is set for development/testing.
- Interactive options on boot:
  - `c` choose channel (stable/beta/nightly/exp-labs/custom)
  - `l` list digest-pinned entries from `${OS_TARGET}-catalog` if present (newest first by `created`)
  - `r` enter custom ref (tag or digest)
  - `o` override OS payload repo/tag defaults interactively
- Installer boot waits for `network-online.target` and bootstraps ORAS if missing.
- After flashing, the installer appends payload-selection provenance to the installed
  `/etc/ourbox/release` before poweroff.

## Official builds
- Official Matchbox workflows now publish the OS artifact first, then build the installer with that exact digest-pinned OS ref baked into `OS_DEFAULT_REF`.
- Official installers bake `INSTALL_DEFAULTS_REF=''` for deterministic default installs; operators can still override via `/boot/firmware/ourbox-installer.env`.
- Push-to-`main` official candidate builds consume the pinned refs in `release/official-inputs.env` and publish the `beta` lane.
- Stable builds are a promotion of that already-published candidate digest after a matching published GitHub Release authorizes it; they are not rebuilt on release.
- Scheduled nightly integration builds resolve the latest `sw-ourbox-os` `edge` platform bundle digests at workflow time and publish the `nightly` lane.
- GitHub prereleases authorize promotion of the same candidate digest into `exp-labs`.

## Catalog TSV
- Tag: `${OS_TARGET}-catalog`
- Columns: `channel tag created version variant target sku git_sha platform_contract_digest k3s_version img_sha256 artifact_digest pinned_ref`
- Kept up to date automatically by `tools/publish-os-artifact.sh` when channel tags are pushed.
- Resolver behavior does not depend on append order; `created` is the tie-breaker.
