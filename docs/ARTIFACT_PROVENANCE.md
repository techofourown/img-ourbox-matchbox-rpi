# Artifact Provenance — OurBox Matchbox

This document is the required audit record for `img-ourbox-matchbox` per the
[Official Artifact Build and Provenance Policy](https://github.com/techofourown/org-techofourown/blob/main/docs/policies/OFFICIAL_ARTIFACT_BUILD_AND_PROVENANCE_POLICY.md)
and
[ADR-0008](https://github.com/techofourown/org-techofourown/blob/main/docs/decisions/ADR-0008-adopt-organization-controlled-build-infrastructure-for-heavy-artifacts.md).

---

## Artifact types produced

| Artifact | Description |
|---|---|
| OS image | Bootable NVMe OS image for Raspberry Pi 5 + dual NVMe (`.img.xz` + SHA-256 checksum + metadata) |
| Installer media | Bootable installer that writes the OS image to NVMe (`.img.xz` + SHA-256 checksum + metadata) |

Both are published as ORAS OCI artifacts (non-runnable) to GHCR.

---

## Official release channels

| Channel tag(s) | Artifact | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `rpi-beta` / `rpi-installer-beta` | OS image / Installer | Push to `main` using pinned `release/official-inputs.env` (heavy build) |
| `rpi-stable` / `rpi-installer-stable` | OS image / Installer | Candidate-completion promotion after a matching GitHub Release `published` authorization (no rebuild) |
| `rpi-nightly` / `rpi-installer-nightly` | OS image / Installer | Scheduled integration build using floating upstream `edge` refs (heavy build) |
| `rpi-exp-labs` / `rpi-installer-exp-labs` | OS image / Installer | Candidate-completion promotion after a matching GitHub Release `prereleased` authorization (no rebuild) |

Registry namespaces (from `release/official-artifacts.env`):
- OS image: `ghcr.io/techofourown/ourbox-matchbox-os`
- Installer: `ghcr.io/techofourown/ourbox-matchbox-installer`

Heavy publish lanes create immutable build tags (`main-<sha12>-rpi`, `nightly-<sha12>-rpi`) and
their installer equivalents. Stable and exp-labs promotions add versioned aliases to an existing
digest instead of rebuilding it.

Moving channel tags (`rpi-beta`, `rpi-stable`, `rpi-nightly`, `rpi-exp-labs`) always point to the
latest artifact in that channel.
A catalog tag (`rpi-catalog`) accumulates one TSV row per published build.

---

## Trusted release contexts

- Push to protected `main` branch (beta candidate build)
- Scheduled nightly integration publish (floating upstream `edge` inputs)
- Candidate completion on protected `main` plus GitHub Release `published` authorization for stable promotion
- Candidate completion on protected `main` plus GitHub Release `prereleased` authorization for exp-labs promotion

These are the only authorized triggers for the official publication lane.
`workflow_dispatch` is intentionally absent from all official publish/promote workflows.

---

## Public build entrypoints

| Operation | Entrypoint |
|---|---|
| End-to-end build + flash | `sudo ./tools/ops-e2e.sh` |
| Build OS image only | `sudo ./tools/build-image.sh` |
| Build installer image | `sudo ./tools/build-installer-image.sh` |
| Publish OS artifact | `./tools/publish-os-artifact.sh deploy` |
| Publish installer artifact | `./tools/publish-installer-artifact.sh deploy` |
| Flash to NVMe | `sudo ./tools/flash-system-nvme.sh` |
| Prepare installer media | `./tools/prepare-installer-media.sh` |

All build logic lives in this repository. Official and compatible builds use the same entrypoints.
Official status derives from the publication identity (TOOO-controlled GHCR namespace), not from
hidden build logic.

---

## Official release workflows

| Workflow | File | Runner | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Official candidate | `.github/workflows/official-candidate.yml` | `[self-hosted, official-heavy, pi-image]` | Push to `main` (source-filtered) |
| Integration nightly | `.github/workflows/integration-nightly.yml` | `[self-hosted, official-heavy, pi-image]` | Daily cron |
| Official promote stable | `.github/workflows/official-promote-stable.yml` | `ubuntu-latest` | Candidate completion; promotes only when a matching GitHub Release `published` exists |
| Official exp-labs promote | `.github/workflows/official-exp-labs.yml` | `ubuntu-latest` | Candidate completion; promotes only when a matching GitHub Release `prereleased` exists |

The heavy build lanes (`official-candidate.yml`, `integration-nightly.yml`) run on
organization-controlled build infrastructure in the `official-heavy-artifacts` runner group.
Promotion workflows run on `ubuntu-latest` because they retag an existing digest rather than
rebuilding it.

### Trigger filtering

`official-candidate.yml` uses `paths-ignore` to skip publication for documentation-only changes.
The following paths do not trigger a candidate build when changed:

```
docs/**
README.md
CLAUDE.md
```

All other paths are treated as potentially artifact-affecting and do trigger the candidate build.
If a source change lands outside these ignored paths, it will trigger publication even if it
does not materially affect the built image.

`integration-nightly.yml` is schedule-driven and intentionally ignores repo path filters.
The candidate-completion promotion workflows are also unfiltered because they do not rebuild: they
only retag an already-published immutable digest after an explicit GitHub Release authorization
is present for that candidate commit.

### Forcing an official republish without source changes

Touch `release/REVALIDATION_TRIGGER` in a PR. That file is not in the `paths-ignore` list,
so merging a change to it will trigger `official-candidate.yml`. Use this when you need an
official artifact after infrastructure maintenance or runner migration, without making a
substantive code change. See `release/REVALIDATION_TRIGGER` for the documented procedure.

### Non-publishing revalidation

`.github/workflows/revalidate-matchbox-build.yml` runs the full build pipeline on the official
builder weekly (Sunday 03:00 UTC) and on `workflow_dispatch`. It does NOT publish official
artifacts. Use it to confirm the release-capable path works after infrastructure changes, per
the ADR-0008 revalidation requirement.

## Provenance metadata

Every published artifact carries the following provenance in its OCI annotations:

| Field | Value source |
|---|---|
| `org.opencontainers.image.source` | `https://github.com/techofourown/img-ourbox-matchbox` |
| `org.opencontainers.image.revision` | Git commit SHA (short, 12 chars) |
| `org.opencontainers.image.version` | `OURBOX_VERSION` env (`main-<sha12>` / `nightly-<sha12>` / local `dev`) |
| `org.opencontainers.image.created` | Build timestamp (UTC, ISO 8601) |
| `techofourown.artifact.kind` | `os-image` or `installer-image` |
| `techofourown.target` | `rpi` |
| `techofourown.variant` | `prod` |
| `techofourown.sku` | `TOO-OBX-MBX-BASE-001` |
| `techofourown.platform-contract.digest` | Digest of `platform-contract` bundle baked in |
| `techofourown.build.workflow` | GitHub workflow name |
| `techofourown.build.run-id` | GitHub run ID |
| `techofourown.build.run-attempt` | GitHub run attempt |

Additional metadata is published as artifact files:

- `os.meta.env` / `installer.meta.env` — full provenance record including K3S version, upstream contract source/revision/version/digest, image SHA-256, and size
- `os.img.xz.sha256` / `installer.img.xz.sha256` — SHA-256 checksum for offline verification
- `os.info` / `installer.info` — pi-gen build info (if present)

Canonical artifact identity for consumption is **by digest** (e.g., `ghcr.io/techofourown/ourbox-matchbox-os@sha256:...`).

Promotion workflows do not rewrite the artifact payload or its embedded metadata. Stable and
exp-labs semantics live in the promoted tags and catalog rows; the underlying artifact keeps the
channel-neutral build identity from the heavy publish lane.

---

## Upstream input pinning

The official candidate build consumes pinned OCI artifacts from `sw-ourbox-os` (defined in
`release/official-inputs.env`):

```
PLATFORM_CONTRACT_REF=ghcr.io/techofourown/sw-ourbox-os/platform-contract@sha256:<digest>
AIRGAP_PLATFORM_REF=ghcr.io/techofourown/sw-ourbox-os/airgap-platform@sha256:<digest>
```

These MUST be digest-pinned refs (never floating tags).

The scheduled nightly integration build intentionally overrides those pins at workflow time by
resolving the latest upstream `edge` digests before building.

To update when `sw-ourbox-os` ships a new bundle:

```bash
# Re-resolve current digests
oras resolve ghcr.io/techofourown/sw-ourbox-os/platform-contract:edge
oras resolve ghcr.io/techofourown/sw-ourbox-os/airgap-platform:edge-arm64

# Update release/official-inputs.env with new digests, open a PR
```

The update must go through a PR so that the pinned refs are reviewed and the next candidate build
publishes a new promotable beta artifact.

---

## Cryptographic signatures and attestations

**No cryptographic signatures or attestations are currently used.**

Provenance is established via OCI annotations, digest-pinned upstream refs, and the
`os.meta.env`/`installer.meta.env` files accompanying each artifact. Users should consume
artifacts by digest to ensure they receive exactly what was published.

When signatures or attestations are adopted, they will be documented here and the claim will
only be made for artifacts that actually carry them, per policy rule 8.

---

## Compatible artifacts

Third parties may build compatible artifacts from this public source using the same documented
entrypoints, subject to their own environment configuration. Compatible artifacts built outside
TOOO-controlled publication are not official TOOO artifacts.
